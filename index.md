## About
The Candian Engineering Competition (CEC) is Canada's premier competition for undergraduate engineering students. Since its inception in 1985, CEC has invited the top 150 engineering students each year to compete in one of eight exciting competition categories.

In order to qualify, students must first win in an intra-university competition and then achieve top placement in the ensuing regional compeitions (Western, Ontario, Québec, and Atlantic regions). In 2019, the culmination of those efforts will bring competitors to showcase their skills at the University of Waterloo in the heart of our nation's tech and innovation hub.

## Competition
### Competition Categories
#### Engineering Consulting
Competitors will design and present a detailed solution to a large-scale engineering problem faced by real world clients.

#### Engineering Communications
Competitors will describe an applicable process or issue and form a coherent argument that clearly identifies its social, economical, technological, and environmental impacts.

#### Innovative Design
Competitors will develop new technological designs or improve upon existing ones and deliver their research and ideas via a professional presentation.

#### Junior Design
Competitors in their first or second academic year of studies will be given a real-world problem to solve. They must use their knowledge of general engineering principles to work within time and budget constraints to design, create, and test a physical prototype of their proposed solution.

#### Senior Design
Competitors in their third or fourth academic year of studies will be given a complex real-world problem to solve. They must use their knowledge of advanced engineering techniques to work within time and budget constraints to design, create, and test a physical prototype of their proposed solution.

#### Parliamentary Debate
Competitors will defend or refute a previously undisclosed resolution topic that relates to engineering using the format of parliamentary debate.

#### Programming
Competitors will be tasked with creating, testing, and presenting industry-quality software that solves a given engineering challenge.

#### Re-Engineering
Competitors must redesign an existing product or process to either improve its functionality or to adapt it for a completely new purpose.
